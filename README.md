# Cards-Garbage
A working program to play the card game Garbage (AKA Trash).

## About
I created this program as an item to showcase in my portfolio. It allows up to 4 players to play a game of Garbage (Also known as Trash). However this is still a work in progress and is not complete at this time. Currently, to the extent of my knowledge, a full game can be played but there are no AI opponents and no message announcing a winner. 

## How to Play
The basic rules to play can be found [here](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Trash#Playing_Your_Turn).
The only differences here being there are no Jokers and currently the game is limited to 4 players.

## Comments
Since this is a portfolio piece and I'm always looking to learn more, any feedback is appreciated. Specifically in terms of code although a note or two towards the visuals probably couldn't hurt. It should also be noted that I did not create the game of Garbage or several of the images and any rights go to the respective owners.
